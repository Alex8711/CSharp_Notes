// sometimes we dont know the details of implement of the base class
// then we can use base class

// abstract class can have non-abstract properties and methods!
// the abstract properties and methods must be in abstract class!!
// abstract class can not be instantiated!

// the derived class must implements all abstract members!

// you can not put "private" in front of abstract members!

// abstract class does have constructor!
